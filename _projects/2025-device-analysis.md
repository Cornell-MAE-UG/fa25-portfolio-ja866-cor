For my Thermodynamics course - MAE 2210 - we were asked to select a real-world instance of the devices we studied in the course, explain its functions, perform an analysis of the system with methods learned in the course, and discuss how changes in its operating conditions would impact performance.

A pressure washer nozzle is an interchangeable attachment for a pressure washing device, altering the outcoming stream flow to best suit the desired task. I focused my analysis on Quick Connect (QC) nozzles. By industry standards, a QC nozzle is categorized based on the spray angle, that is the divergence of the fluid flow upon exiting the nozzle. Smaller angles produce more concentrated, powerful streams. They are color-coded by their spray angle, as outlined by the chart to the right (1). They are also categorized by their orifice size, which is the nozzle opening that releases the spray. The inlet opening, where the nozzle attaches to the washer hose, is a standard diamater of 0.25 inches.

The most deciding factors in choosing a nozzle are the required concentration of flow, and the specifications of the pressure washer to be utilized - the operable pressure and fluid flow rate. Usually, the machine is rated in pounds per square inch (PSI) and gallons per minute (GPM), respectively (2). These two operating characteristics can be used to determine the desired orifice size, which are usually tabulated on a reference chart.

For my analysis, I will assume the pressure washer is the RYOBI 1.8 GPM Automotive High Flow Pressure Washer (3), which is rated at 1200 PSI and 1.8 GPM. I will analyze the 25° QC nozzle from RAW Industrial Supplies (4). First, I'll determine the appropriate nozzle size using the chart to the left, provided by RAW Industrial Supplies. For my washer, a standard nozzle size of 3.5, which corresponds to a hole diameter of 0.048 inches, is appropriate.
